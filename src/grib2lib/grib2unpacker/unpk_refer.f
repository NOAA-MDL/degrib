C        PURPOSE
C           DETERMINES WHAT PACKING SCHEME WAS USED TO PACK THE DATA.
C           DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT THE USER WANTS THE DATA RETURNED
C           WITH OR WITHOUT MISSING VALUES IMBEDDED IN IT. IF THE USER
C           DOESN'T WANT MISSING VALUES IMBEDDED WITHIN THE DATA FIELD,
C           THEN A BIT-MAP IS RETURNED TO THE USER INDICATING THE
C           LOCATIONS OF THE MISSING VALUES. IF THE USER WANTS MISSING
C           VALUES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DATA FIELD, THEN NO BIT-MAP
C           IS RETURNED FROM THIS ROUTINE. THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO
C           THIS IS WHEN THE USER HAS A PREDEFINED BIT-MAP. IN THIS
C           CASE, A BIT-MAP IS NOT RETURNED TO THE USER, AND THE
C           DATA FIELD IS RETURNED WITHOUT MISSING VALUES IN IT.
C
C           THE ONLY PACKING METHOD IN WHICH A BIT-MAP IS PACKED INTO
C           THE GRIB2 MESSAGE ALONG WITH THE DATA FIELD IS THE SIMPLE
C           PACKING METHOD. FOR THE COMPLEX AND SECOND ORDER
C           DIFFERENCING METHODS OF PACKING DATA, A BIT-MAP IS NOT
C           ACTUALLY PACKED INTO THE GRIB2 MESSAGE. MISSING VALUES
C           ARE INCLUDED IN THE PACKED DATA. IF THE USER DESIRES A
C           BIT-MAP WITH THESE PACKING METHODS THEN THE PROGRAM
C           WILL GENERATE ONE.
C
C           IN ADDITION TO PRIMARY MISSING VALUES, THE COMPLEX
C           PACKING METHOD ALLOWS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SECONDARY
C           MISSING VALUES. IF THE USER WANTS A BIT-MAP RETURNED
C           FROM THE UNPACKING OF A DATA FIELD THAT HAS BOTH
C           PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MISSING VALUES IN IT, AND THIS
C           DATA WAS PACKED USING THE COMPLEX METHOD, THEN ONLY
C           THE LOCATIONS OF THE PRIMARY MISSING VALUES WILL BE
C           INDICATED BY THE BIT-MAP. IN THIS CASE, ONLY THE
C           PRIMARY MISSING VALUES WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE
C           DATA FIELD.
