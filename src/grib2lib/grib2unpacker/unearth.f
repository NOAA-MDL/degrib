C        PURPOSE
C            UNPACKS INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE SHAPE OF 
C            THE EARTH FROM SECTION 3 OF A GRIB2 MESSAGE.
C            THE INFORMATION THAT THIS ROUTINE PROCESSES IS BASED
C            ON TABLE 3.2 OF THE WMO GRIB2 DOCUMENTATION AND IS
C            REQUIRED BY MANY OF THE MAP TEMPLATES IN SECTION 3.
