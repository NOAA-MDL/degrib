C        PURPOSE
C            TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE NO VALUES
C            IN THE GRID. THREE POSSIBILITIES ARE CHECKED BY THIS
C            ROUTINE:
C
C            1) THERE ARE NO VALUES IN THE GRID, BUT THERE IS A
C               BIT-MAP AND IT INDICATES THAT THERE SHOULD BE. THIS
C               IS TREATED AS AN ERROR.
C            2) THERE ARE NO VALUES IN THE GRID, AND THE BIT-MAP
C               INDICATES THAT THERE ARE NO VALUES IN THE GRID.
C               THE USER IS NOTIFIED AND THE FIELD IS
C               PACKED USING THE SIMPLE METHOD.
C            3) THERE ARE NO VALUES IN THE GRID, AND THERE IS NO
C               ACCOMPANYING BIT-MAP. THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED TO
C               BE A REASONABLE SITUATION. IT IS TREATED AS AN
C               ERROR.

C                       THE SIMPLE METHOD IS USED (K=1,NXY).
C                       COMPLEX AND SPATIAL DIFFERENCING DO NOT
C                       USE A BIT MAP, BUT WILL ACCEPT ONE AND INSERT
C                       THE MISSING VALUES.
