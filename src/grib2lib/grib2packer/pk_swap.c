* MODULE NUMBER: 1
* MODULE NAME:   pk_swap_
*
* PURPOSE:       This routine reverses the ordering of the bytes in each 4-byte
*                word of an integer array.  For example consider the following
*                4-byte word whose bytes contain the characters 'A', 'B', 
*                'C', and 'D':
*
*                  byte 1   byte 2   byte 3   byte 4 
*                  A        B        C        D
*
*                This routine will reverse the ordering of these bytes in this
*                4-byte word so that the contents of each byte of the word 
*                will appear as follows:
*
*                  byte 1   byte 2   byte 3   byte 4 
*                  D        C        B        A
*
*                The need for this routine arises from differences in
*                memory architecture across different computer platforms.
*                The two memory configurations that need to be accomodated
*                are the "Big Endian" and "Little Endian" architectures.
*
*                In the "Big Endian" architecture, the left-most byte in a
*                word is the most significant byte.  In the "Little Endian"
*                architecture, the right-most byte in a word is the most
*                significant byte.
*
*                As another example, consider a 4-byte integer which contains
*                the value 66.  On a "Big Endian" system, the binary pattern
*                in a word would appear as follows:
*
*                00000000 00000000 00000000 01000010
*
*                On a "Little Endian" system, the binary pattern would 
*                appear as follows:
*
*                01000010 00000000 00000000 00000000
*
*                This routine ensures that a GRIB2 message will be accurately
*                decoded regardless of the memory architecture of the computer
*                that it is being decoded on.
