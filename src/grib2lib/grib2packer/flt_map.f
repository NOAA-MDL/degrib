C
C        PURPOSE
C            PROCESSES THE BIT-MAP ASSOCIATED WITH A GRID OF REAL 
C            DATA VALUES.  EXACTLY HOW A BIT-MAP IS PROCESSED DEPENDS
C            PRIMARILY UPON WHICH PACKING METHOD IS BEING USED TO
C            COMPRESS THE GRIDDED DATA.  THE BIT-MAP INDICATES WHERE
C            MISSING VALUES ARE LOCATED IN THE DATA FIELD BEING PACKED.
C            A 0 INDICATES A BAD VALUE WHILE 1 INDICATES A GOOD VALUE.
C            THERE IS A ONE-TO-ONE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE VALUES
C            IN THE BIT-MAP AND THE DATA IN THE DATA FIELD BEFORE THE
C            MISSING VALUES ARE REMOVED.
C
C            A BIT-MAP IS REQUIRED WITH SIMPLE PACKING TO
C            INDICATE WHERE MISSING VALUES ARE LOCATED IN THE
C            DATA FIELD.  IF A FIELD TO BE PACKED USING THE
C            SIMPLE METHOD ISN'T ACCOMPANIED BY A BIT-MAP AND
C            THERE ARE MISSING VALUES EMBEDDED IN THE DATA,
C            THEN THIS ROUTINE WILL GENERATE A BIT-MAP AND
C            REMOVE THE MISSING VALUES FROM THE DATA FIELD.
C
C            THE COMPLEX PACKING METHOD DOES NOT NEED A BIT-MAP
C            TO INDICATE WHERE MISSING VALUES ARE LOCATED IN THE
C            DATA FIELD.  A BIT-MAP CAN BE SUPPLIED BY THE USER
C            IF THEY ARE PROVIDING A DATA FIELD WITHOUT THE MISSING
C            VALUES IN IT.  THIS ROUTINE WILL PLACE THE MISSING
C            VALUES INTO THEIR PROPER PLACES IN THE GRID IN THAT
C            CASE AND ELIMINATE THE BIT MAP.
