NAME
   tkdegrib: Provide a GUI front end to degrib, which allows one to work
      with GRIB files in various ways.

SYNOPSIS
   tkdegrib

DESCRIPTION
   Allows a GUI interface to the following degrib functions:
      1) Inventory GRIB files.
      2) Convert from GRIB to various formats.

   Does not provide GUI access to these degrib functions:
      3) Get Meta data from a GRIB message.
         - Can create the .txt file, but can't easily view it.

   Does not provide any access to these degrib functions:
      4) Probe GRIB files at a specified lat/lon.
      5) Convert NDFD GRIB2 files to flat file database
      6) Probe the flat file database.

   It does the GUI part by implementing a Grib2 package in Tcl/Tk.

   Grib2Init [Grib2 Command name]
      Creats a new "object" with the given command name

   [Grib Command name] [subcommand] ?options?

         "-refTime"

   [Grib Command name] inquire ?options?  (depricated)

         "-msg $msg" "-msg $msgNum"
         "-Met true"
         "-Shp false"
         "-Flt" "-Flt true"
         "-NetCDF $ray(NetCDF_Version)"
         "-Csv true"
         "-MSB $ray(f_msb)" "-nMSB"
         "-majEarth $ray(majEarth)"
         "-minEarth $ray(minEarth)"
         "-Unit e" "-Unit $ray(f_unit)"
         "-Decimal $ray(decimal)"
         "-poly $ray(f_poly)"
         "-nMissing $nMissing"
         "-GrADS $ray(f_GrADS)"
