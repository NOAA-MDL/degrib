<span class="black"><strong>Relative Humidity (RH)</strong>  is a ratio, expressed in percent, of the amount of atmospheric moisture present relative to the amount that would be present if the air were saturated. Since the latter amount is dependent on temperature, relative humidity is a function of both moisture content and temperature. Relative Humidity is derived from the associated Temperature and Dew Point for the indicated hour.
