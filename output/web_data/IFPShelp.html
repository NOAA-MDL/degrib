      <P><span class="normaltext">AWIPS, the modernized National Weather Service 
      data display system now in operation across the United States, provides 
      forecasters with the best tools to view and understand the past, present, 
      and future state of the atmosphere. Using a variety of data and new 
      computer technology, forecasters are able to integrate satellite and radar 
      imagery, surface and upper air observations, and numerical computer 
      guidance to produce accurate, detailed, and up-to-date forecasts. The 
      Interactive Forecast Preparation System (IFPS) within AWIPS allows 
      forecasters to prepare and display <I>graphical</I> forecasts as 
      effectively as possible.</span></P>
      <P><span class="normaltext">The displayed images are experimental, graphical representations of 
      text forecasts. You may notice <I>small</I> differences in detail, 
      otherwise the images should provide a reasonable depiction of the expected 
      weather. To view the graphical forecasts, rollover the times listed.
      Alternatively, press the loop button, to go to a seperate interface which
      allows the user to loop/step through forecasts for each element by time. 
      To print a single image, click the "Print" button on the "loop" page. Definitions 
      are also available for each element, by clicking on the element name. Additionally 
      a color legend of the weather combinations and abbreviations used for the "weather"
      element is available. If applicable, the directional icons near the top 
      of the page can be used to navigate to adjacent experimental graphical 
      forecast sites.</span></P>
