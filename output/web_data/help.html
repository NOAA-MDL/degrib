      AWIPS, the modernized National Weather Service 
      data display system now in operation across the United States, provides 
      forecasters with the best tools to view and understand the past, present, 
      and future state of the atmosphere. Using a variety of data and new 
      computer technology, forecasters are able to integrate satellite and radar 
      imagery, surface and upper air observations, and numerical computer 
      guidance to produce accurate, detailed, and up-to-date forecasts. The 
      Interactive Forecast Preparation System (IFPS) within AWIPS allows 
      forecasters to prepare and display <I>graphical</I> forecasts as 
      effectively as possible.</span></P>
      
      <P><span class="normaltext">The NWS National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) 
      receives updated forecast grid data, currently at 5 km resolution, 
      from NWS forecast offices. 
      The forecast data are combined to produce mosaic forecast grids over the entire United States. 
      Still experimental, the mosaic forecast data and derivative forecast 
      products, will eventually be made available to partners and the public 
      in graphical, textual and other forms.  
      Currently, data from 13 forecast offices in two different
      regions are available for downloading from the ftp server.
      </span></p>
      
      <P><span class="normaltext">This software package contains a program
      that generates the forecast images from the NDFD data
      and a script for generating the HTML pages to view the images.  
      Together with the data downloading and decoding programs, they 
      give users the ability to conveniently download and view the forecast data.
      Two types of HTML pages are created.  The tabular pages lists the time projections of each 
      weather element in a table.  
      You can view the forecast image for the weather element and time period 
      of interest by placing the mouse over the corresponding link in the table.  
      More than one page is created if the number of element columns (depends on the number of weather elements 
      selected on the downloading GUI) 
      exceeds five.  In this case, you can get to the second page by clicking the 
      right arrow at the bottom of the table.  The animation page contains the regular set of
      animation buttons.  Select the weather element of interest and click the start button to start 
      the animation.  The images for the selected element will be shown for successive time projections.
      This page also contains
      a shortcut for printing the image that is currently displayed.
      The pages are best viewed with a screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher.  
      Also try use the small system font if you would like to have all time projections
      fit in the browser window.
