<strong><span class="largefont">COMBINED SEA</span></strong><span class="normaltext">  Generally referred to as SEAS. Used to describe the combination or interaction of wind waves and swell in which the separate components are not distinguished. This includes the case when swell is negligible or is not considered in describing sea state.  Specifically, SEAS = <IMG SRC="/web_data/seasformula.gif" alt="square root of the result of height of swell wave squared plus height of the wind wave squared">  where S is the height of the swell and W is the height of the wind wave.  When used, SEAS should be considered as being the same as the significant wave height.</span></P>
