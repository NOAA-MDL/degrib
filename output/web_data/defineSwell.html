<strong><span class="largefont">SWELL WAVE</span></strong><span class="normaltext">  Surface gravity waves on the ocean that are not growing or being sustained any longer by the wind.
Generated by the wind some distance away and now propagating freely across the ocean away from their area of generation, these waves can propagate in directions that differ from the direction of the wind, in contrast to a wind sea.
