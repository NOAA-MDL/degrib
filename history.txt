          with a spacing of .5, but the point is at 359.6) (r616)
#
#----- Release: Version 1.90 10/31/2007 -----
#
10/29 AAT Introduced a -avgInterp option which when doing bilinear
          interpolation (see -Interp), if a point is surrounded by 1 or more
          missings, it returns the inverse distance weighted average of the
          non-missing corners, instead of missing. (r610)
10/29 AAT Updated to 20071029 version of dwmllib
      PH  dwmllib bug: in which number of days formatted in XML was 1 more day
            than specified in -numDays command line argument. The bug occurred
            from 05Z to 12Z.
      PH  dwmllib bug: in which weather data was not falling into the correct
            summary period.
      PH  dwmllib bug: in which too much data was clipped when user specified
            startTime and endTime arguments for time-series and glance products
10/29 AAT Added a check to degrib2.c::ReadSECT0() to make sure the edition is
          1 or 2 when detecting a "GRIB".  If not, it ignores the false
          positive and keeps looking for "GRIB".  This should help people who
          have wrapped GRIB messages with text which for example says "this
          is a GRIB message". (r608).
10/24 AAT Added a table for some support for Norway GRIB1 products.
10/23 AAT In pack.c::fillSect3(), there is a request for angle, which is
          intended to define the basic unit of angle (lat/lon) for lat/lon
          grids when not the default value of 10^-6.  I accidentally used
          "angleRotate" which was undefined instead.  This caused a failure
          for -Grib2 on some linux machines.  Others randomly had a default
          value of 0 which made it work sporadically.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.89 10/22/2007 -----
#
10/22 AAT Fixed a bug in writeshp.c introduced in 1.87 where a missing '\0'
          resulted in failure of -Grib2 on some linux installs (r604)
10/19 AAT Began adding logic to allow draws of lat/lon grids.
10/19 AAT Fixed a bug with ParseSect4TimeSec() introduced in 1.87 which didn't
          recognize a unit of "seconds" (element 13 in a table of 13 units).
10/19 AAT Updated to the latest version of dwmllib.
10/18 AAT Fixed a bug recognizing CPC ProbTMP products.  Had been keying off
          a specific value (2550) in the lower/upper probability thresholds.
          This value was changed to 0, so I didn't label it above / below
          average.  (Note it worked for Precip because that was handled in a
          different section of code). Longer term solution is to have WMO /
          NCEP add elements to the ProbType, since in this case the prob above
          or below 0 isn't really applicable to the grid (should be above or
          below average grid cell height).

#----- Release: Version 1.88 10/18/2007 -----

10/17 AAT Added genProcess to genElemDescript structure (r594)

10/12 AAT Added probType to genElemDescript structure
10/12 AAT Introducing 12 new CPC (Temp / precip) (above / below) avg types
          for the XML to work with. (r584)
10/3  AAT The NCEP library 1.0.2 stored the lower / upper limits of
          probabilities using unsigned ints, whereas version 1.0.4 used signed
          ints.  This was so 1.0.4 could store negative thresholds using a
          "sign bit".  The problem is that NCEP already stored neg values in
          1.0.2 using "2's complement + 1".  For backward compatibility, we
          can now read either method of storing a neg value. (r579)
10/1  AAT Fixed the new GMOS element listings in ndfd.ini (r578)

          neighbor, 2=bi-linear.  Probe code assumed boolean (no interp vs
          bi-linear).  Now use f_interp and f_coverageGrid.
          0: <none> -> f_interp = 0, f_coverageGrid = 0
          2: -Interp -> f_interp = 1, f_coverageGrid = 1
          1: -Interp 1 (or near) -> f_interp = 0, f_coverageGrid = 1

          (r374)
 2/16 AAT fixed the method used to check memory allocation in g2_unpack2.c
 2/16 AAT added drawshp.txt to /degrib/docs
 2/15 AAT Adjusted sectors/numSectors prior to calling expandInName so if a
          point falls on Puerto Rico, it grabs data from nhemi as well. (r369)
 2/9  AAT Added support for labeling Error Grids (RTMA) (r362)
 2/9  AAT modified sector.c to be more forgiving in SectorFindGDS, and to add
          point sector information.  PntSectInfo now contains a list of the
          sectors a point fall in.  A point does not count multiple times when
          creating the "sector" list.  eg a point in "conus,nhemi,alaska" only
          counts as "conus" in the sector list, but has an entry of
          "conus,nhemi,alaska" in its point-sector list. (r361)
 2/7  AAT modified genprobe.c to check if a match already exists for the 4
          items: refTime,validTime,f_sector,ndfdEnum.  If so, then don't
          create a second match.  Only way to do that is if we have duplicate
          copies of the data on the drive. (r358)
 2/7  AAT modified expandInNames to include the "root directory" only once.
 2/7  AAT Adjusted sectors/numSectors prior to calling expandInName so if a
          point falls on conus, it grabs data from nhemi as well.
 2/7  AAT Changed behavior of -DP so a point falling outside the grid returns
          missing instead of nearest grid cell.  (DC should not have a value
          on the Hawaii grid).
 2/7  AAT Enabled WG and Tropical cyclone winds for -DP and -DC options
          Need to deal with -DC / tropical cyclone glitches.
 2/7  AAT Adjusted match type to include sector information for genProbe.
 2/5  AAT Updated makefile.aix32/aix64 to use DWMLFLAGS
 1/31 AAT Adjusted ReadSECT0 to allocate in 200 byte increments instead of 5.
 1/24 AAT Corrected the indexing of pnts in Grib2DataProbe so it can handle
          multiple -DP points correctly.
 1/24 AAT Modified makefile.aix32 and makefile.aix64 to use
          -bmaxdata:0x30000000 so they have ~800 megs of dynamic memory
          available.
 1/24 AAT Modified makefile's which use -ansi to pass -c99 to dwmllib code
          to support // comments.
 1/24 AAT Fixed strTrimRight() and strTrim() based on emails from Joe Lang.
          Unsigned int loop counter couldn't handle a string filled with
          only spaces (i >= 0 was always true).
 1/24 AAT Fixed bi-linear interpolation based on jeff.sharkey's email.  I was
          interpolating holding y constant, but accidentally used the values
          as if I was holding x constant.
 1/23 AAT Added SPC metaname information which will be released on Feb 27.
          Decided to add an override in ParseElemName() to help keep names
          closer to what was dictated.
 1/11 AAT NUMDAYS uses valTime 2,3 (instead of 1,3)
 1/10 AAT Adjusted NumDays to be +12 hours instead of +36 hours.
 1/9  AAT Added -startDate and -numDays options for XML 3,4
11/7  AAT updated degrib1.c to handle center 9 subcenter 161 data for GRIB1.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.84 11/03/2006 -----
#
11/3  AAT Added Canada tables to the GRIB1 handling code
11/3  AAT Updated metaname.c to have an updated centers list (and added ARINC)
11/3  AAT Fixed "/src/grib2lib/config_H/config.h.nonGcc to have no _ after the
          name for FORTRAN name mangling purposes.
10/26 AAT Adjusted /bin/MakeData.tcl to use catch
10/25 AAT Addressed the GRIB2MISSING_s4 issue.  Signed missing 4 byte integer
          should be -1 * 2^31, while unsigned missing 4 byte integer should be
          2^32 -1.  I had checked all 4 byte missings by casting them to
          unsigned and comparing to 2^32 -1.  Without the cast, the
          -1 * 2^31 is compared to 2^32 -1 resulting in no match (Error).
          With the cast it becomes 2^31 +1, instead of 2^32 -1, (Error).
          The solution is to check s4 against -1 * 2^31, and u4 against 2^32.
10/19 ADT code in the gd subdirectory to take care of the case when a broken
          unistd.h does not define some needed symbols.
10/19 ADT The beginning of a --with-debug configure to turn on DEBUG defines:

10/12 AAT updated /src/makefile.* clean step to clean up extra binaries.
10/12 AAT updated /src/degrib/makefile.aix?? to pay attention $(TCL_VERSION)
10/2  AAT Modified "/src/grib2lib/g2clib-1.0.2/grib2.h to use "SIZEOF_LONG_INT"
          instead of "__64BIT__" (note my code use to use "_64Bit")
10/2  AAT Updated the makefile.* files in /src/grib2lib with current #defines.
 9/29 ADT Moved ADT_AIXSIZE from configure.in to aclocal.m4 and fixed an error

 3/13 AAT Added ability to handle "local surfaces" (table 4.5 metaname.c)
 3/9  AAT Changed FindGRIBMsg() back to return -2 at EOF (which is what it
          was supposed to do).  The mutliple files had changed it since they
          weren't an "error".  Changed the calls in cube.c and commands.c to
          treat -1 as error, but not -2.
 3/9  C_D (Claude Desrochers): Modified makefile.sgi to have:
          "DP_LIB = -L../emapf-c/ -lemapf -L/usr/lib32 -lm"
 3/8  AAT Modified the weather error log option in probe.c and weather.c
 2/28 AAT Modified -Freq to round before creating the freq table.
 2/24 AAT Added libxml to makefile.linux.

 2/23 AAT Jack Settelmaier found a bug with configuration of the NDGD 4-7
          day forecasts for PoP12, PoP06, and RHM.
 2/22 AAT Jack Settelmaier found a bug with tcldegrib -V used from the
          tkdegrib about window. (one fewer element in list caused a indexing
          problem) 2/19 AAT Switched from OperDir to OpnlDir in ndfd.ini for
          consistencey
 2/21 AAT Gave out first version of 1.76.
 2/19 AAT Updated ndfd.tcl,http.tcl to key off of opnl instead of oper for
          both NDGD and NDFD (used to be oper for NDGD, opnl for NDFD)
 2/19 AAT Intro opnl version of AQ (ozone01, ozone08).  Need both opnl, expr.
 2/18 AAT Added ability for -XML to recognize ds.maxt.bin and maxt.bin

 2/17 AAT Added parsing for "-XML glance" option.
 2/17 AAT Added a -Freq option to create a frequency distribution of the
          values in the grid.
 2/17 AAT For -NetCDF 2,3, before appending a message, it now checks if the
          message has the same reference time as the one in the file.  If so
          it adds it.  If not, it overwrites the file.
 2/16 AAT Added code in metaname.c to handle thunderstorm 03 / 06 / 12.
 2/16 AAT Added -Sector command back into the degrib_DP code.
 2/15 AAT Checked NCEP's meta tables for updates.  Found "0,3,198".
 2/15 AAT Made sure that metaname.c can handle the new gridded MOS PoP's
 2/13 AAT Created degrib_DP (for just the -DP option).
 2/10 AAT Completed commenting the genProbe.c routines.
 2/8  AAT Completed test routines for -DP option.
 2/7  AAT Adjusted short name on ProbWindSpd to ProbWindSpd06.
 2/6  AAT Started in on genProbe and -DP option.
 2/2  AAT Fixed a bug found by "george" in myMapf.c handling of lat/lon grids
          when lon1=-11, and lonN=3 (ie U.K.).
 2/2  AAT Went back and commented genprobe.c
 2/1  AAT Tracked down test failures on other OS's.  Currently reduced it to:
          "test40 (linux) -> Round error"
          "test62 (lin/aix) -> differ picture encode)",
          "test69 (all) -> want different behavior"
 1/31 AAT Removed checks for 255 when looking at lenTime (template 4.5, 4.8,
          4.9 (maybe 4.12)).  If lenTime is "missing" it should be set to
          2^32 -1 instead of 2^8 -1.
 1/31 AAT Found a bug in clock when dealing with timezones:
          ./clock scan "1/31/2006 9:08:27 CST" |
          ./clock format stdin -format "%D %T" -zone CST
          Did not return the original value.  It needed to treat timezone as
          hour (rather than sometimes sec) to add to local time to get UTC.
 1/30 AAT Detected a bug in AllocSprintf when it is called with
          buffLen > strlen(buff).
 1/30 AAT Introduced -gribFilter for finding files when "expanding" a directory
 1/30 AAT Introduced -ndfdConven for -NDFDVars option.

 1/13 AAT Created a -MOTD option 1 and 2
 1/10 AAT Debugged genProbe command.
 1/5  AAT Worked on genProbe command.
 1/3  AAT Updated metaname.c tables based on (version 3):
          http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/WMOCodes/Operational/GRIB2/FM92-GRIB2-2005nov.pdf
12/29 AAT Thanks to Jack Settelmaier got access to some GRIB1 clustered
          ensemble data and found that the section length was 86 instead of
          100.  Modified degrib1.c to not complain about a length of 86.

12/11 AAT Thanks to Kevin Cross, Fixed a typo (meaurable) in
          /degrib/output/web_data/defineQPF.html".
#
#----- Release: Version 1.75 12/07/2005 -----
#
12/7  AAT Investigated the inventory of a probability file.  The inventory
          was not decoding the limit factor correctly for template 4.9.
          This is because GRIB2 uses a 1 in the most significant bit to denote
          a negative value, instead of casting the sChar to an uChar.  Found
          a bug in NCEP's encoder because for template 4.5 it cast the sChar
          to a uChar.
12/7  AAT Adjusted metaname.c to watch for APCP and tack on the # of hours
          used in the accumulation (APCP12, APCP06, etc)
12/7  AAT Created makefile.aix64 which has 64 bit support.  Have tested it
          against the test suite, and behaves the same as the makefile.aix32
          NOTE: tcldegrib and tkdegrib don't compile as the libraries on
          the IBM were made in 32 bit mode.
12/7  AAT Added some meta data support for ensemble GRIB1 messages.  See:
          http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/ens/info/ens_grib.html
12/6  AAT Switched all "long int" to "sInt4" (to get 64 bit compliance)
12/6  AAT Improved check for "degrib <file> -C -NetCDF -msg 1" syntax error.
12/6  AAT Added check in tkdegrib configure to make sure custom is 20x20.
12/6  AAT "degrib file.ind -DC -Help" error message was less than informative.
12/6  AAT Fixed "-DP -Asc2Flx" error when it doesn't have -pnt.
12/6  AAT Fixed -Asc2Flx errors for dates larger than year=2001.
12/6  AAT Fixed tkdegrib problem with inventory'ing a directory with files
          with [] in the name (Jack Settelmaier Bug).
11/16 AAT Updated Ws/Wd to operational in preparation for 12/8.
11/16 AAT Found a bug in config.tcl dealing with the change from the tree
          structure being labeled ndgd to it being labeled ndgd2
          Bug exists in 1.74, but could exist in version 1.70 to 1.73
11/16 AAT Found out that Guam had gone operational (tt,mx,mn,po,dp,wx) on
          9/20/2005
11/15 AAT Updated GRIB1 meta data to have a:
          "PDS-S4 | Output grid" statement (with a "-Unit e")
11/9  AAT Started adding template 4.12 (see sref data).
          changes to metaparse.c, metaprint.c, inventory.c
          Need to double check, and determine which files get overwritten
          (894 txt files, but 932 messages with -nameStyle %e_%v_%s.txt).
          (905..908 appear (-I) to be identical?)
          Turns out to be APCP-3,6,12,24
11/9  AAT Changed behavior of Local Use look up for NCEP.  If not HPC
          uses NCEP's standard local use look up, otherwise uses HPC's.
11/9  AAT Updated subcenters in metaname.c NCEP now has Space Environment
          Center
11/8  AAT Found out that IBM pow function doesn't like uChar for input
          pow (10, uchar value) -> pow (10, (int) (uchar value))
11/8  AAT Resolved a portability bug in Inventory (rounding of delt time
          in inventory print.
11/8  AAT Resolved a portabilty bug in metaprint (used %g instead of %f for
          Lower Limit / Upper Limit).
11/8  AAT Put in a check if the NetCDF file has a different unit than the
          requested unit, then it overwrites the old NetCDF file.
11/8  AAT Managed to test against Ryan Boyles NetCDF bug.
11/7  AAT Implemented web.tcl on the IBM, and created RenameConv 2 to handle
          some naming convention issues.
11/4  AAT Re-wrote web.tcl to handle all the NDGD, and cleaned it up some.
11/4  AAT Re-wrote web.tcl to handle apt.bin and rhm.bin
11/4  AAT Removed "[NDGD_Variables], [NDGD_Sectors]" sections of ndfd.ini
11/4  AAT moved mosgfs/conus/day1-3/maxt.bin to gfsmos/conus/maxt_d13.bin
11/4  AAT Switched order of "MOS GFS" to "GFS MOS"
11/4  AAT Adjusted ndfd.ini so ozone is under "AirQual" Folder and put in
          "/data/ndgd/aq" instead of "CONUS" and "/data/ndgd/conus/"
11/4  AAT Fixed web.tcl so it will download NDGD/Ozone again.
11/1  AAT Fixed default "-C -Map" (didn't init the ramp structure correctly)
#
#----- Release: Version 1.74 10/29/2005 -----
#
10/27 AAT Introduced text attribute of EarthRadius, EarthMajorAxis,
          EarthMinorAxis to the "-NetCDF *" MapProjection.  The difference is
          that EarthRadius is "6371.2 km" in text, while EarthRadius_KM is
          "6371.2" as a double.
10/27 AAT Fixed -NetCDF 3: attribute TrueGridLength_Latitude, moved from map
          projection to XCells, YCells
10/27 AAT Better handling of extensions for the -out option.
10/27 AAT Fixed a memory leak introduced by adding multiple GRIB files.
10/26 AAT Improved "-NetCDF 2" and "-NetCDF 3": the FirstProjectionHR
          attribute etc to be able to handle grids that are out of order.
10/26 AAT Improved "-NetCDF 2" and "-NetCDF 3": the valid_min,valid_max
          attribute to be the whole file's valid_min/valid_max.
10/26 AAT Improved "-NetCDF 2" and "-NetCDF 3" to do an insert, instead of
          appending the data to the end.
10/26 AAT Thanks to Anne Frigon: Found out that in the NetCDF I used
          the msgNum to specify where to insert the data.  This results
          in ProjHour filled with numerous missings.  Switched to adding
          to the end.  This results in non-monotonic ProjHour
10/26 AAT Thanks to Anne Frigon: fixed a typo in the NetCDF attributes
          (LowerLeftLatiude -> LowerLeftLatitude)
10/25 AAT Thanks to Kirby Cook, found out that I didn't add a '\0' to end
          of a buffer in writenc.c.  This was used in a test to see if the
          file was created using -NetCDF 1,2,3.  The result made all files
          look like they were created by different options, resulting in
          only allowing 1 message per file.
10/25 AAT Increased the size of gribcut from 15x15 degrees to 20x20 degrees.
10/25 AAT Fixed a "download NDGD folder" bug.

10/21 AAT Converted from time.h to clock.h to enable people to work with
          reanalysis data from 1952.  (time.h has a limitation of 1970 on
          some platforms).
10/23 C_D (Claude Desrochers): Added makefile.sgi to appropriate locations.
10/23 AAT Started to gain the ability to have multiple GRIB files on the
          command line, for help with the XML code.
10/21 AAT Shifted from time.h to clock.h.  To assist Kevin Pace work with
          Reanalysis data from 1954.
10/21 AAT Fixed the calls to gdImageFilledRectangle from fill4SidedObject
10/21 AAT Converted "Inconsistent Projection" in TDLPack to a warning instead
          of a fatal error.
10/19 AAT Modified /degrib/src/gd/makefile.sample to have "gd_security"

          center/subcenter/genID.
 10/5 AAT Re-did meta.h to move center/subcenter to common area
          (from a copy in each of pds1, pds2)
 10/5 AAT Check if NetCDF file was correct "degrib version" before append.
          If not, then over-write.
 10/4 AAT Default choice for MSB is true from degrib, false from tkdegrib
          choose to go with true for default.
 10/4 AAT Added -SimpleVer to tkdegrib (Add simple Wx over ride to the GUI)
 10/4 AAT Added -AscGrid to tkdegrib
 10/4 AAT Added -AscGrid to -Interp option
 10/4 AAT Reason "-Grib" was not working is because "reduce2" function line
          had too many columns.
 10/4 AAT Added "-C -Map" option (needs improvement).
 9/28 AAT Introduced "GetURL.tcl" to /degrib/bin, which allows one to get an
          arbitrary URL by typing "/degrib/bin/tcldegrib GetURL.tcl <URL>"
 9/21 AAT Worked on "-Flt -AscGrid" option
 9/21 AAT Update to "-NetCDF 3" to have HrCells become ProjectionHr, and make
          ProjectionHr a coordinate variable.
 9/19 AAT Introduced "-GrADS 2" (valid time vs reference time)
 9/19 AAT Figured out why "-P -out stdout" behaved differently from
          "-P -stdout"
 9/19 AAT Figured out why multiple calls to -NetCDF 3 -out maxt.nc resulted
          in 1 grid, whereas -NetCDF 3 -msg all -out maxt2.nc resulted in
          8 grids.  Is now consistent.
 9/16 AAT Finished "-NetCDF 3" which should be more "CF" compliant... Modeled
          off RUC example see:
          http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/examples/files.html
 9/16 AAT Added Code to handle MOS PoP06 and MOS PoP12.
 9/12 AAT Changed NetCDF output to have "standard_parallel" attribute with
          2 elements, rather than a standard_parallel_1 and
          standard_parallel_2. (Started to introduced "-NetCDF 3")
 9/8  AAT Switched from "," to ";" in several elements in metaname.c for
          Christopher McIntyre
 9/8  AAT Added NCEP GRIB1 table 131 for Michael Allard and Andrew P Revering

          experiment with (modified metaname.c)
 5/12 AAT Thanks to "rob.doornbos" found a bug dealing with multiple
          closing's of the same file.  Fixed "fclose (out_fp)" in GRIB2Probe()

#
 3/28 AAT Adjusted the inventory of Probability data again.
 3/28 AAT Figured out why degrib was flipping 0p5 degree grib2 data from

 3/22 AAT Get Rid of SNOD NDFD over-ride in metaname.c
 3/21 AAT Probability forecasts from TPC (Template 4.5)
 3/17 AAT Revisited handling of MOS.  Added it after determining short name,
          so that it uses NDFD conventions for the short name, but prepends
          a "MOS-" to it.  May need a "MOSGFS-" instead.
 3/16 AAT Gave Marc 1.67a.
 3/16 AAT Added MOS_Overide[] table, and created IsData_MOS() in metaname.c

          to specify a forth element which is the file to output that point
          to.
 1/23 AAT PntFile: Due to some requests (chrism and others), degrib no longer
          allow the space separator.  This allows stations with spaces.  So
          you have to use commas.

 1/10 AAT Continued TDLPack compression: Glahn: 151,176 me: 230,856 -> 230,480
 1/7  AAT Continued TDLPack compression: Glahn: 151,176 me: 302,192
 1/5  AAT Started in on TDLPack writing routines. Not very good compression:
          Glahn: 151,176 me: 618,672 -> 330,848
12/29 AAT Adjusted code to handle "missing" for sndSurface type.

12/14 AAT Updated "metaname.c::Choose_LocalParmTable" for HPC Grids.
12/13 AAT --- 1.64 Handed jcraig a preliminary copy of the changes he
          suggested to writenc.c for him to evaluate.
12/13 AAT Updated some of the web pages.
12/13 AAT Finished incorporating "jcraig" changes to writenc.c
          (Adds a "-NetCDF 2" option (version 2)).
12/13 AAT Updated makefiles to handle pure cygwin situation "better".
12/8  AAT Changed "stderr" to "stdout" in web.tcl so the .'s are in the
          correct chronological order in cron jobs.
12/3  AAT Added a "-validMin" and "-validMax" to make sure numbers are
          resonable.
12/3  AAT Fixed web site's copy of "history.txt" (modified the font some).
12/3  AAT Switched to NCEP GRIB2 current library and return 7 if we
          have a corrupt section 7.
          1) Detects "too many byte read" due to corrupt group width
          2) Detects "too many numbers" due to corrupt group length.
12/2  AAT Adjusted MDL GRIB2 library to 705 if
          1) Detects "too many byte read" due to corrupt group width
          2) Detects "too many numbers" due to corrupt group length.
12/1  AAT Adjusted NCEP GRIB2 library to return 14 if we have corrupt
          section 7.
          1) Detects "too many byte read" due to corrupt group width
          2) Detects "too many numbers" due to corrupt group length.
12/1  AAT Search for "CASE" in other files.
12/1  "jcraig" provided enhanced NetCDF code.
12/1  "jcraig" pointed out that "SELECT CASE" is not F77 compliant.
          He provided changed code for "unpkSect3.f".
12/1  AAT Detected that GRIB2 library doesn't handle corrupt section 7s well.
          1) Can try to read too many bytes due to corrupt group width
          2) Can try to store too many numbers due to corrupt group length.
12/1  AAT Fixed bug in library that caused it to always use NCEP's library.
12/1  AAT Fixed a memory leak in "FindGRIBMsg()".
#

#
11/29 AAT Implemented sector based operational/experimental variables.
11/23 AAT Implemented "Simple Weather Version 4". (New Default).
#
#----- Release: Version 1.61.A (Announced Web site update) 11/18/2004 -----
#
10/29 AAT Found bug with handling of missing / undef with GrADS ctl files.
          Thanks to "DNovak3098"
10/20 AAT Found a bug with commands.c::GetOutputName when using -out stdout.
          When code changes the file extension and there isn't any memory
          allocated (bug introduced in 1.60, and 1.61).
10/6  AAT Worked on support for extracting a TDLPack gridded message.
10/5  AAT Added support for Inventory'ing TDLPack.
 9/29 AAT Don Bauer pointed out that images weren't being generated except
          for wave height.  This lead me to detect a bug in ndfd.tcl which
          was blocking the creation of images unless waveh images needed to
          be created, at which point it generated all the images.
 9/16 AAT Dave mentioned problems with "Chc:T:...^Def:RW:..." does not get the
          correct color (due to Marc's Algorithm).  Need new -SimpleVer
 9/14 AAT Experimented with metaname.c :: Choose_LocalParmTable();
 9/14 AAT Corrected writeshp.c :: CreateWxDbf()
          fprintf (fp, formBuf1, id, buffer, index, vis, index);

#
 8/26 AAT Added ability for hawaii and guam to generate images.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.60 08/24/2004 -----
#
 8/24 AAT Thanks to Ken Waters found a typo in NDFD_GenImages
 8/23 AAT Thanks to Ken Waters (and myself) we detected a bug in my handling
          of mercator grids when I used NCEP's routines.  The result was
          a "scan mode 80" error, and a DX=.064 meters.
 8/23 AAT Added /degrib/arcview/readme.txt to distrib lists.
 8/23 AAT Activated Hawaii, and Guam Sectors of NDFD.
 8/23 AAT Bind return in GIS Tab (top RT pane) to be double click.
 8/23 AAT "-C -out stdout" and "-C -stdout" sends meta to standard out.
 8/20 AAT Redid how age of files are handled in tkdegrib (faster)
 8/20 AAT Tested web.tcl with "custom ndfd".
 8/20 AAT Tested web.tcl with ndgd and ndfd.
 8/19 AAT Adjusted Inventory so it looks at first 5000 bytes in a ".tar" file
          before giving up.
 8/19 AAT Finished the browse button.
 8/19 AAT Attempted to fix all other "file open bugs".
 8/18 AAT Fixed file open bug in "Grib2IsGrib2Obj()"
 8/18 AAT Started to add browse button...
 8/17 AAT Finished adding NDGD.
 8/16 AAT Modified "english weather translation" in "probe.c" to have
          "A, B and C" instead of "A and B and C".
 8/16 AAT Finished debuging weather.c for "unknown coverages".
 8/13 AAT Adjusted the Weather Table for the new weather keys.
          ESRI Weather issue: Original "HazCode" was based on 5 hazards,
          where each hazard was a number between 0 and 10 which I sorted and
          created a 5 digit number out of.  That is no longer feasible since
          there are now 11 Hazarads.  So the new "HazCode" is a 10 digit
          number.
 8/12 AAT Added -refTime command option.
 8/11 AAT Adjusted tkdegrib to use tree structure on the download page.
          This will allow one to download a subset of variables,
          and allow one to start handling the NDGD.
 8/6  AAT Adjusted ParseElemName() so Template 4.9 gets units of % and there
          is no unit conversion.
 8/2  AAT Added "GenericProbe()" "hook" for FORTRAN to call, instead of
          using temporary files, or messing with "user" function.
 8/2  AAT Adjusted radEarth from GRIB1 files to be 6371.2 if from NCEP.
 8/2  AAT Adjusted metaprint.c and metaparse.c to handle
          40000->40 and 40010->41 shifts.
 8/2  AAT Adjusted drstemplates.h, g2_addfield.c, and g2_unpack7.c to handle
          40000->40 and 40010->41 shifts.
 8/2  AAT Adjusted grib2api.c to allow 40, 41 to also have is5[20] determine
          if it is float or int data. (aka: not depend on 40000, 40010).
 8/2  AAT Adjusted unearth.f to handle case code table 3.2 cases 4,5,7.
 8/2  AAT Updated code for new code table 3.2 (and put in checks that radEarth
          is in range of 6300 km to 6400 km. (should be 6371.2 km).
 8/2  AAT Fixed 0.0000-SFC for NDFD inventoriy. (Related to 7/22 fix).
 7/30 AAT Finished AirForce Param Table.
 7/29 AAT Worked on AirForce Param Table.
 7/28 AAT NOAA 2004 Web Conference Talk!
 7/26 AAT Worked on AirForce Param Table.
 7/23 AAT Worked on AirForce Param Table.
 7/22 AAT Resolved GetOutputName when surface is '0.33'.
 7/22 AAT Modified metaname.c::ParseLevelName() to allow a 0.33 surface.
 7/20 AAT Added handling for "template 4.8 with no time range."
 6/21 AAT Adjusted handling of code table 3.2 to be "hard wired" values.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.53 06/18/2004 -----
#
 6/18 AAT Tested some AirQual grids.  I should key off lenTime instead of
          timeIncr to find the "length of the Average".  (ie 0zone8 has
          lenTime=8 since it is an 8hr average, but timeIncr of 0).
 6/18 AAT Custom becomes official! See:
          http://products.weather.gov/viewliste.php?page=4
 6/9  AAT Modified GRIB1 part to allow "extended" lat/lon grids (ie stretched
          or stretched and rotated lat/lon grids.
 6/2  AAT Continued to update the ozone names.
 6/1  AAT Updated names ozone names (to reflect 8 and 1 hour averages).
 5/24 AAT Allowed -pnt to take non lat/lon values (for -grid true option).
 5/24 AAT Added some checks for ASCII corrupted GRIB2 messages to degrib2.c
 5/24 AAT Finished updating GRIB1 table NCEP OPN/129/130
 5/20 AAT GRIB1: Paid attention to table 5 (Time range indicator) and which of
          P1 and P2 are the valid times.  This means better calculations of
          valid time for GRIB1 messages.
 5/20 AAT Fixed undesirable probe in off grid cell locations.  When not using
          -Interp, if a lat/lon results in a cell that is off the grid, it had
          returned the value of the nearest grid cell.  Now returns missing.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.51 05/18/2004 -----
#
 5/18 AAT Found a bug in MetaPrint.c:PrintSect4_Category.
 5/18 AAT Added an entry in metaname.c for NDFD AirQual.
 5/17 AAT Ported to various platforms
 5/14 AAT Added a way to handle a bad Tcl/SSH exit on NCEP's machines.
          (Exiting Tcl in a SSH session causes the session to lock.)
          (Solution: create an exit handler that just exits... just make
           sure you actually call "exit" from the tcl script.)
 5/13 AAT Bug in tendian.c::memBitRead(), for big-endian machines, it didn't
          correctly right justify the bytes when numBytes != sizeof (dst).
 5/12 AAT Adjusted probe.c with -nLabel to all decimals (instead of integer)
 5/11 AAT Added local section info for ozone project (metaname.c)
 5/11 AAT Fixed metaparse.c::ParseGrid() so that it computes the correct range
          of values when dealing with a bitmap.
 5/11 AAT Fixed call to GRIB2 library.  Was expecting "clean" to be 0, instead
          of 1.  This affects simple packing with bitmaps.  I expected some
          kind of holder value to be embeded in the data (clean of 1 doesn't
          do that.  clean of 0 does).
 5/10 AAT Can now handle GRIB2 compressed files with "complex" or "complex
          spatial differencing" methods" which have a bitmap (MDL-Library
          does not support this).
 5/10 AAT Found out that I used the opposite definition for bitmap
          Correct answer is: 0 = missing, 1 = valid.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.50 05/07/2004 -----
#
 5/7  AAT Changed default of "-Flt" to "-nFlt".
 5/6  AAT Started putting in links from GUI to NetCDF routines.
 5/6  AAT Ported to AIX-32, and HP-Gcc platforms (linux was simple).
 5/5  AAT Switched to 2 decimal (from 1) recomendation for QPF.
 5/5  AAT Finished commenting "writenc.c" : Now have NetCDF capability
          (1 message to 1 NetCDF file).
          Need: a) -Interp option, b) Multiple messages to 1 NetCDF file.
 5/5  AAT Updated the version of "emapf-c"
 5/5  AAT Announced the 2004 Partner's Workshop meeting.
 4/30 AAT Added gridID to pdsG1Type (see meta.h)
 4/23 AAT Bug fix: writeshp.c::gribWriteShp() Incorrect in computation of
          fieldLen1 / fieldLen2.  Didn't handle a min values of "-0.01"
          correctly.  Assumed log10() was always positive.. log10(0.01) = -2.
          (found this bug due to "aviation GRIB1 Supercooled large droplet")
 4/22 AAT Bug for web.tcl (occassional 0 byte files) Hypothesis, the http
          lines were full.  Solution: More attempts, pause between attempts,
          another diagnostic message.
 4/15 AAT Initial experiments with NetCDF complete... Starting writenc.c
 4/5  AAT Bug in -P -Interp (chrism)... Probing points outside the grid
          returns 9999.  Not a bug, but undesired behavior for Lat/Lon
          grids which have the left border 1 grid cell away from the right
          border.  In that particular case, we can interpolate outside the
          grid.
 4/2  AAT In GIS tab browse on "program files" causes stack trace. (drice57)
#
#----- Release: Version 1.48 04/01/2004 -----
#
 3/29 AAT In GIS tab, full filename is in path (instead of just directory)
 3/29 AAT Cleaned up files (comments / long int->sInt4) stopped with database.c
 3/26 AAT Added -LatLon_Decimals option.
 3/25 AAT Found out that grib1tab.c was not consistent.  Cleaned up the tables
          and made sure the short name contained none of the following:
          " ./+()<=>"
 3/24 AAT Added UC_K2F for all [K] variables (GRIB1 and GRIB2).
 3/24 AAT Worked on short surface name (replaced : with - in 2 level values
          version of GRIB1 code)
 3/24 AAT Worked on short surface name (added 2 level values to GRIB2 code)
 3/24 AAT Updated metaprint label for jpeg and png type compression.
 3/24 AAT Fixed problems with surface names for GRIB1... Used to start
          tacking surfaces together.. example:
          0-MSL0-MSL0-SFC0-SFC0-SFC2-HTGL2-HTGL10
 3/23 AAT Fix based on chrism bug... mymapf.c was setting up a lat/lon grid
          incorrectly if the scan mode was anything except 64.
 3/23 AAT Added ability to convert GRIB1 data's units to english / metric.
          (wasn't paying attention to the TMP, MAXT... stuff).
 3/22 AAT Introduced -nLabel option.
 3/22 AAT Error in default name style. Should be "%e_%v.txt" not "%E_%v.txt"
 3/22 AAT Taught the GRIB1 variables TMP, MAXT, MINT, APCP about
          UC_K2F and UC_InchWater
 3/22 AAT Modified output meta to emphasize computed unit conversions
 3/17 AAT Web page updates...
#
#----- Release: Version 1.47 03/17/2004 -----
#
 3/16 AAT Bug fix: chrism reports -pntStyle 1 and -pntStyle 2 don't do labels
          correctly... Fix was in probe.c::GRIB2ProbeStyle1()
#
#----- Release: Version 1.46 03/15/2004 -----
#
 3/15 AAT Fixed the ParseLevelName() command to stop "tacking on" surfaces
          when doing a -msg all -nameStyle "%s.txt"
 3/15 AAT Fixed some bugs with then new -nameStyle
 3/12 AAT Made the -nameStyle more flexible, and added surface option to it.
 3/12 AAT Added "-cells true" to "-cells all".  This allows one to probe a
          specified set of grid cell (see -pnt and -pntFile) instead of all
          cells, without knowing the lat/lon of that cell.
 3/12 AAT Created -surface short, -surface long... During a probe this will
          output the surface level either in the short form or the long form
 3/12 AAT Discovered that the "split poly" during big poly save was not
          completed (that is, the first and last point were not the same)
 3/11 AAT Cleaned up the big polygon dateline split.
 3/10 AAT Fixed small polygons for Alaska.
 3/5  AAT Relabeled inventory from "#, Byte, ..." to "MsgNum, Byte, ..."
 3/5  AAT Switched ParmTable (GRIB1) to GRIB1ParmTable (should fix GRIB1
          unit probe label problem.)
 3/5  AAT For LATLON grids made sure that lon is in 0..360
 3/4  AAT Switched to 6 places of accuracy (because that is native of GRIB2
          messages... note this may cause HP problems with tests)
 3/4  AAT degrib1.c:ReadGrib1Sect4() Switched {# Pts * (# Bits in a Group) +
          # of unused bits != # of available bits} to a warning from an error.
 3/4  AAT Added timing diagnostics (miliseconds) on downloads)
 2/23 AAT Improvement on web.tcl (suggested by chrism) (puts current filename)
 2/20 AAT Bug Fix to "web.tcl" for missing directory (AK). (Reported by chrism)
 2/20 AAT Bug Fix to "web.tcl" for missing snow in PR. (reported by chrism)
 2/20 AAT Some experimentation with importing into ArcGIS
 2/20 AAT Found out that "c:/ndfd/degrib1.4/..." is not a good name for
          ArcGIS toolbox... Use "c:/ndfd/degrib1_4/..." instead.
 2/19 AAT Added -majEarth and -minEarth options to tkdegrib.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.44 02/17/2004 -----

 2/11 AAT Remember to ask Mark Price to check out Debian issue (see 2/2)
 2/11 AAT Adjusted metaparse to accept GRIB2 master table version 2.
 2/10 AAT Added ability to convert ASCII (.ini type) file to index (flx) file
 2/10 AAT Tested subgrid communication potential.
 2/9  AAT Completed the subgrid options for -Grib2 option, and tested on a
          linux machine.
 2/7  AAT Enable stdout writes for -Grib2 option.
          NOTE: To do this in Win32, we are no longer using -ansi.
          because in windows, stdout is ascii, and can't be changed inside
          C using ansi C (shouldn't be true in unix/linux).
 2/7  AAT Update copy of NDFD usage document.
 2/7  AAT Relabel -lowLeft -lwlf and -upRight -uprt
 2/7  AAT While inventorying ./data/fh.0001_tl.press_gr.bgrib, found that it
          is a corrupt file... This caused ParseTime from ReadGrib1Sect1()
          to segFault (because the year was 1300)  Now using ParseTime to
          detect if GRIB1 files are corrupt (from download).
 2/6  AAT Solved the -lowLeft -upRight problem for both -C and -DC.
 2/6  AAT Solved the "decode grib2" -> "encode grib2", and
          "decode grib2" -> Data Cube -> "encode grib2" problem for NDFD.
 2/5  AAT Save 7 decimals to the data cube so we don't lose accuracy when we
          re-read it, and pack it as a GRIB2 file.
 2/5  AAT BUG:: -msg all didn't get subgrids
 2/4  AAT BUG:: metaparse.c didn't allow non-meteo or ocean products
 2/4  AAT BUG:: grib2api.c For submessages, I did a mem-swap twice, which
          corrupted the data.
 2/4  AAT BUG:: metaname.c ParseLevelName did not properly anticipate local
          defined level tables.
 2/4  AAT BUG:: inv->shortFstLevel = NULL added for subgrid messages.
 2/4  AAT BUG:: Inventory line 726 fread -> FREAD_BIG (to determine if we have
          end of message.
 2/2  AAT Removed having both a ain and iain data element.
          (speed increase of 10%)
 2/2  AAT Removed a number of the automatic array dependencies.
          (Mark Price brought this up in 1/21/2004 email)
 1/29 AAT Removed a level diagnostic in GRIB1 parsing.
 1/28 AAT Update to emapf configure files... haven't tested.
 1/27 AAT Learned about proxy http servers, added option to configure window.

 1/22 AAT Added an "automatic select" of -Decimal in "Recommend" button.
 1/22 AAT Changed the default for -Decimal back from 0 to 3 because the image
          Generation didn't work.  Better solution have a default based on
          variable... Put that on todo list.
 1/22 AAT Worked on making sure the release is valid (and started in on some
          packer codes).
 1/21 AAT Replace 'D' comments with 'C' comments in the Fortran code
          (This is so that it works in Mac OSX with Bell labs f2c).
          (Wyatt Miller brought this up in 11/13/2003 email)
 1/21 AAT Fixed the size issue of the UNIX GUI (wm geometry after wm minsize)
 1/21 AAT Fixed reported failure of GUI on linux (SystemButtonFace -> Gray85)
 1/21 AAT Changed default Wx.colortable to new version.
 1/21 AAT Added movable walls in inventory part of GIS tab.

 1/20 AAT Added a "recommend" button for filename selection in the GUI.
 1/20 AAT Fixed GUI occurance of GMT -> UTC
 1/20 AAT Added new Weather types (specifically WX_BN, WX_ZF, WX_IC, WX_IF,
          WX_VA, WX_ZY, WX_WP).  Added them to end of list, instead of
          changing "wx-inten".
 1/16 Doug Marcy: Gave a ArcView Legends Tutorial Doc
 1/16 Doug Marcy: Gave a version of his ArcView Legend files (to mimic the
          imageGen color tables)
 1/16 AAT Finally entered in GRIB1 NCEP Parameter Table 130.
 1/16 AAT Added shortFstLevel and longFstLevel to meta data structure, and

 1/13 AAT Modified mymapf.c to output lon in range of -180..180
          This allows support of the "1/2 degree grid from NCEP."
 1/13 AAT Found out that eqvlat has to be after mkGeoid for emapf
 1/12 AAT Entered in most of NCEP's GRIB2 local tables into metaname.c
 1/12 AAT Decided to add a column of "long form", and remove the "ForeHr"
          field to the GUI.
 1/12 AAT Detected that [clock seconds] in Win98 returns system timezone,
          instead of GMT which WinXP returns.
 1/12 AAT Made image generation button dependent on existance of
          "superImageGen.exe" (instead of imageGen.exe)
 1/12 AAT Added check of file size of .png != 0 before sending to pngqudim
 1/12 AAT Michael Pat Murphy had problems installing to "program files" (win98),
          Needed to change open "|$imageGenName... to open "|{$imageGenName}...
 1/9  AAT Modified "browse for file" to have either .shp or .flt type.
          instead of always .flt.  Bug fix at request of Doug Marcy.
 1/9  AAT Changed the default for -Decimal from 3 to 0 at request of Doug
          Marcy.  Most variables need 0, although some might need 1.  One
          possibility is to make the default change based on variable.
 1/9  AAT Switched from using dmapf-c to emapf-c because of eliptical earth in
          some of the RUC fields.
 1/9  AAT Thanks to Mark Fenbers suggestion, I've updated ./src/Makefiles to
          have "make clean" be "cleaner". :-)

12/29 AAT Changed degrib1.c :: ReadGrib1Sect2() so NV != 0 is a debug time
          warning instead of a fatal error.  PV != 255 is still a fatal error.
12/29 AAT Discussed with Albion Taylor about non-spherical map projections

12/15 AAT Finished rough draft of API for NCEP GRIB2 decoder library,
          and passed a linux only version (1.33) off to FSL.
 12/1 AAT Started in on a API wrapper around NCEP GRIB2 decoder
11/21 - 11/29 Vacation (Sofia's baptism in CA, Thanksgiving in MA)
11/20 AAT Worked on "ConvertChain2LtLn()" which should address the dateline
          issue for "big polys".  (after changing "CreateBigPolyShp()" some)
          Will then try to use a similar method for the small polygons.
11/20 AAT Cleaned up the "chainType" structure (didn't need value since that
          was in the "polyType" structure (chain.h)
11/20 AAT Continued debugging the latlon projection shape file method.
11/19 AAT Created a wrapper for the map projection calls so that the program
          could handle latlon grids.
11/13 AAT Bug report by Scott Archer... Debian Linux doesn't work with the
          FORTRAN library (suggested problem with file (inventories fine))
          (suggested --stack (Not available in non i386 ld))
          (error code "303" = UNSUPPORTED GRID TEMPLATE INDICATED)
11/13 AAT Bug report by Wyatt Miler... FORTRAN code wouldn't compile in OS X.
          Suggested changing "D" for comments to "C".

10/21 AAT Improved http.tcl and ndfd.tcl to attempt to re-get data that is
          incomplete.
10/20 Matthew T. Kallio "matt" (weather underground):
          Problem: CreateBigPolyShp() gave a seg-fault error on linux but not
          on windows.  Solution:
             FWRITE_LIT (&parts, sizeof (long int), numParts, sfp);
          => FWRITE_LIT (parts, sizeof (long int), numParts, sfp);
10/20 AAT (Release notes for 1.30 went out Today (Monday)).
#
#----- Release: Version 1.30 10/17/2003 -----
#
10/16 AAT Updated ./data/imageGen/cities/cities.sample
10/16 AAT changed RootDir to "OperDir" and "ExprDir" in ndfd.ini
          So we can have operational and experimental NDFD variables.
10/16 AAT Added "-P -cells all"
10/15 AAT Fixed f_interp "use weather code"
10/15 AAT Added f_interp option to gribInterpFloat() (Now have "-Interp near")
          Inform Peter Resch (9/30 request)
10/15 AAT Continued validating variables all work for new GIS tab choices.
10/15 AAT Memleak fixed when tcldegrib is called with invalid options.
10/15 AAT Bug fix with computing bounds of a "big" polygon.  Initial value
          was choosen incorrectly.
10/14 AAT Added .5 to each point to get big poly to match little...
          because chain used a grid that started at 0,0.  projections used
          a grid that started at 1,1.  Also the chain centered the values,
          where-as the projections had the values on the latice points.
10/14 AAT Added preliminary improvement for new GIS tab choices.
10/7  AAT Allowed -DP to have "-Index ./conus/ds.maxt.ind".  This used to be
          an error.  It only allowed "-Index ds.maxt.ind", so you had to cd to
          the data directory first.
10/7  AAT Allow "ds.maxt.ind" as an -Index file. (two '.'s in filename)
10/7  AAT Worked on Tcl and C calls to "-poly big".
10/6  AAT Finished the -poly big option (20 seconds)
10/3  AAT Finished the -poly big option (13 min .. 10 min .. 8 min .. 5 min)

 9/9  AAT Modified makefiles to consistently use ranlib (in grib2unpacker)
 9/9  AAT Validated Radius of Earth change (6367.47 -> 6371.2 km)
 9/9  AAT Created automatic way to get rid of ^M in source code.
 9/8  AAT Adjusted interpretation of scale value / factor for metaparse.c

 9/8  AAT Adjusted ndfd.tcl to use MaxT_Tropical.colortable (for PR).
 9/8  AAT Updated ./docs/NDFD_GRIB2Decoder.html
 9/8  AAT Removed some unused colortables (plain MaxT, MinT, and T, and
          WindGust).  Added "MaxT_Tropical", "MinT_Tropical", "T_Tropical",
          and "Td_Tropical"
 9/8  AAT Updated "./data/imageGen/cities/cities.sample"
 9/8  AAT Created a web.tcl script in ./degrib/bin
          Purpose: Sample automated method of "getting" the http files from
          the web (Used Tcl but not Tk, so it can be put in cron).
 9/5  AAT Created a "MakeDataBase.sh" script in ./degrib/bin

 8/22 AAT Finished getting ready for "Great Divide Workshop"
 8/21 AAT Almost finished the -DP and -Data options.
 8/21 AAT Added -nRevFlt option.
 8/20 AAT Removed dependence on fileLen... (May now start using stdin?)
 8/20 AAT Improved the error catching in inventory.c::GRIB2SectJump() by
          paying attention to return from fread, and checking fseek with a
          fgetc / ungetc combo, instead of "computing" where we should be.
 8/19 AAT Changed the 8/14 ugly string "" fix from a new table item to an
          adjustment to weather.c::UglyLookUp()
 8/19 AAT Consolidated cstart.c and tcldegrib.c version of ConvertCmd().
 8/19 AAT Updated probe test because of 7/22 fix.
 8/18 AAT Improved "usage" so user doesn't have to read too much.
 8/18 AAT Switched to just one command per run.
 8/18 AAT Started to introduce assert statements (see myerror.h)
 8/16 AAT Found out how to save a tiny bit of memory by re-arranging typedef
          structures.
 8/14 AAT NOTE: Mark Maciver (maciver) had problems downloading complete data
          Possible cause: Data updated about 20 after the hour, so it may have
          interupted his data retrieval.
 8/14 AAT Fixed Wx bug that Marc Pointed out.  metaparse.c::ParseSect2_Wx()
          When the section2 group does not have a '\0' at the end, I made a
          false assumption when storing the last string.  This caused a string
          to not have a '\0' terminator.
 8/14 AAT In ugly strings: allowed "" in 'visibility' field, 'intensity' field,
          'weather' field, and 'coverage' field (already allowed in 'hazard'
          field).
 8/13 AAT ----- NDFD Technical Workshop -----
 8/11 AAT Put release notes on-line.
 8/11 Rici Yu: Updated version of superImageGen (hopefully avoids infinite
          loop case that was detected with conus / PR for MaxT)
 8/8  AAT Probe.c bug fix for wx. Send missing to 9999 instead "missing"
#
#----- Release: Version 1.25 08/07/2003 -----
#
 8/7  AAT Resolved: "degrib foo -I" where foo is NOT a GRIB2 file.
 8/6  AAT fixed: 'tk_messageBox debug message left in when converting to .flt'
 8/6  AAT Added -pntStyle option, (at the request of Matt and Jim Scott).
 8/6  AAT Found a logic error when parsing "-pntFile".  Can now handle
          "lat,lon", in addition to "station,lat,lon"
 8/6  AAT Added -WxParse option for Probe point when dealing with weather.
 8/6  AAT Fixed spelling of "hazzard" to "hazard" in creation of .shp file
          for weather.
 8/6  AAT Added -Separator option for probe point.
 8/5  AAT Found out how to import .flt files into ArcGIS with the correct
          projection.  Now providing:
           ./degrib/arcview/ndfd.prj -> For setting a layer's projection
           ./degrib/arcview/prj.adf -> For setting a grid's projection.
 8/5  AAT cstart.c:ParseUserChoice(), improved handling of next = NULL error.
 8/1  AAT inventory.c:GRIB2Inventory(), made it so that it only has a
          GRIB_LIMIT for the first message in the file.  After that
          there can be unlimitted bytes between messages.
 8/1  AAT Updated qpf.colortable, and sky.colortable
 8/1  AAT Updated cities.sample ./degrib/data/imageGen/cities
 8/1  AAT Memory leak in degrib1.c:ReadGrib1Record() I had allocated UnitName,
          copied data into it, then set it to NULL (The set to NULL was
          probably a debug test that got left in).
#
#----- Release: Version 1.23 07/31/2003 -----
#
 7/31 AAT Added defense for the case where there are fewer Wdir and Wspd
          messages than Temperature.
 7/31 AAT Added new version of htmlmaker (for "help" key)
 7/31 AAT Got new definitions for help pages used by htmlmaker
 7/31 AAT Updated colortables.
 7/30 AAT Resolved "Ken Water and Jamie D. Perez" bug with regards to the
          space in the filename (mkWidget's : pkgIndex.tcl needed work)
 7/30 AAT + Rici Yu : Started in on updating help pages from htmlmaker.
 7/30 AAT Changed weather.c::InitUglySting to initialize the entire UglyString
          data sturcture.  Previously may have been looking at undefined
          values, causing occasional problems.
 7/29 ... Ken Water reports "space" bug in installation.
 7/29 AAT Switched to having meta out of Grib2Type structure in tcldegrib.c
          Thought was that MetaInit and MetaFree should be called more
          frequently to prevent wx mistakes.
 7/28 AAT Incoperated "superImageGen" into ndfd.tcl. Idea of "superImageGen"
          is if you call image creation program 1 time instead of N times
          (once per image) it will speed things up (fewer execs)...
          Turns out it slows it down slightly... Don't know why yet.
 7/28 AAT When tkdegrib needs reftime for a file, can now use "reftime" option
          to just inventory the first message (instead of all messages).
          Speed improvement to start program from approx
          2 min 40 sec (on a 1.7 gHz, with heavy load, and all sectors)
          to: 8 sec (same machine, same situation)
 7/22 AAT Found out that I used ScanIndex incorrectly in probe point...
          The map routines return x,y in range of 1,1 .. Nx,Ny because of NCEP
          (ie FORTRAN) definitions.  ScanIndex expected n,y in range of
          0,0 .. Nx-1,Ny-1 because of "C" definitions.  Switched ScanIndex
          to take 1,1 .. Nx,Ny.
 7/22 AAT Made waveHt with "english" units be "feet"
 7/18 AAT Created a -radEarth option to override the radEarth in the GRIB
          message because NCEP lies in GRIB1 messages giving 6371.2 instead
          of what they claim of 6367.47
 7/17 AAT Found out why after converting a grid using the GIS, one can't
          generate images.  This is because -out option tells the program
          to generate files in output directory instead of in "mosaic"
          directory.  Solution1: Don't preserve any "user" options between
          calls. (Solution2: Preserve some of the options) (chose solution1).
 7/17 AAT Found out that tcl/tk was not calling Grib2CmdDel() on exit.
          Forced it to by using proc foo {} {} to overwrite the cmd.
 7/17 AAT tcldegrib.c::Grib2ConvertObj() did not free outfile correctly.
 7/17 AAT cstart.c::DegribIt() did not free outfile correctly.
 7/17 AAT inventory.c::GRIB2InventoryFree() did not free inv->unitName.

 7/15 Matthew T. Kallio "matt" (weather underground):
          Problem: Probe gave a seg-fault error with (52.2,-78.4436).
          Solution: Adjust an if/else clause in probe.c::GRIB2Probe().
 7/14 AAT Adjusted things so it doesn't try to generate html for snow if snow
          doesn't exist (see PR).
 7/14 AAT Adjusted tcldegrib.c::Grib2ParseObj() to reset the error result
          when it is finished.
 7/14 AAT Added an error check if Wx does not have Section 2 data.
 7/14 AAT Orientation of polygons is once again wrong because 5/30 change was
          after the 5/15 "fix".
 7/14 Marc Saccucci: Update to NDFD Tile files.
 7/14 AAT writeflt::gribWriteFloat() If index not in colortable set to
          undef rather than 0.
 7/14 AAT GS2_WXTYPE error more prevalent than I thought. To solve, created
          a MetaReset() routine called by degrib2::ReadGrib2Record().
          Slightly slower, but safer.
 7/11 AAT Dealt with error when the entire field was missing. (I had added 1
          to the missing number if it fell in the range of min/max, which
          happened with weather?).
 7/11 Rici Yu: Updated version of htmlmaker (better handling of which grids
          ndfd is giving out.
 7/11 AAT made tcl script clean up mosaic files after finished with them.
 7/11 AAT Concerned about meta->pds2.sect2.ptrType == GS2_WXTYPE as test
          for "if the grid is weather".
 7/8  AAT For Dx != Dy, changed from average (Dx, Dy) to using a "wrapper"
          around all calls to the map routines (using a ratio of Dy/Dx).
 7/5  AAT Fixed menu-option download bug (ambiguous command)

 7/2  Rici Yu: Gave a new version of htmlmaker (for Puerto Rico)
 7/2  Rici Yu: Updated version of imageGen.exe:
          Takes a -mapdef option ("sju" for Puerto Rico, "conus" is default)
          Uses the new legend scheme for Wx.
          Has (--logo option) to not add the logos at the bottom of the image
          Other changes to make consistent with other versions of imageGen
 7/1  AAT Finished (I think) the -SimpleWx option for NDFD imageGen.
 7/1  AAT Bug with 0 = max = min when dealing with .dbf file.
 7/1  AAT Continued NDFD_WxTable() (-SimpleWx option).
 6/30 AAT Fixed a bug reported by "matt" (weather underground).  I had a
          memory leak in metaparse.c::ParseSect2_Wx().
 6/27 AAT No longer delete the mosaic files since they were deleted before
          imageGen was able to use them.
 6/23 Matthew T. Kallio "matt" (weather underground):
          "wmo" dimension increased to WMO_HEADER_LEN + 1 (for '\0' char)

 5/30 AAT Added calls to dmapf to allow us to set the RadEarth correctly.
          Can now handle any spherical earth.
 5/30 AAT Removed reliance on errno (since Tcl/Tk confuses the issue).
 5/30 AAT Changed orientation of shp files to start in lower left,
          instead of upper right to be consistent with wgrib, as well
          as the GRID specifications.
 5/30 AAT Relabeled endian.h to tendian.h (because AWIPS Linux has an

 5/20 AAT Found that a stack of 4000000 had problems with some MaxT data
          changed to a stack of 8000000.
 5/20 AAT Changed probe to allow nearest point in addition to interpolated.
 5/20 AAT Switched from using cmapf-c to using dmapf-c.
 5/19 AAT Found a bug in fval_360 (used for degrib1 reference values)
 5/15 AAT Created a simple method of dealing with date-line polygons.
          For polys that span the date-line I use all negative.  The
          problem with this is when we project it.
 5/15 AAT Fixed the inside out polygons... Separate code for non-missing
          was still generating counter-clockwise polygons.
 5/15 AAT Fixed the list view binds to handle double click...
          Bug was icon=foo.txt and a [split $icon .] in mkwidgets.
 5/15 AAT Tweaked the GUI to have iconBox start in small list form.
 5/15 AAT Allows GRIB1 missing value to be 9999, if possible, otherwise use
          9.999e20, if possible, if not, uses max of field + 1.
 5/14 AAT Made the probe command pay attention to -Decimal option.
 5/14 AAT Can probe a GRIB1 file now.  Minor bug fix in updating offset before
          call to ReadGrib1Record.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.13 05/14/2003 -----
#
 5/14 AAT Found out that my polygons are "inside out".
          They are "counter-clockwise" instead of "clockwise".
 5/13 AAT Minor bug in degrib2.c::FindSectLen()
 5/13 AAT Created Icons for GRIB1.
 5/13 AAT Tweaked the # field in the GUI a little.
 5/13 AAT Sped up the "IsGrib2" option from Tcl/Tk, by putting a limit on
          how many bytes to search for the GRIB message in (300).
#
#----- Release: Version 1.12 05/12/2003 -----
#
 5/12 AAT Found that on 64 bit machines a long int is 8 not 4 bytes.
          This impacts everything!! (all the sizeof() calls in file IOs)
          (using -q32 for now...)
 5/12 AAT Cleaned up Tcl/Tk "About" routine.
 5/9  AAT Tried to get it to compile and run on the new IBM (Snow).
 5/8  AAT Added -Decimal option.
 5/7  AAT Improved on the GUI to allow it access to options that were
          previously only available on the command line.
 5/7  AAT Fixed up errors in poly creator
 5/7  AAT Enabled -nMissing option so we don't store missing values.
          (smaller files, faster)
 5/6  AAT Cleaned up the .ave script, and added polar, mercator, latlon
          capability.  Tested the polar.
 5/5  AAT Found bug in cmapf-c (eqvlat(90,90) does not return 90).
 5/5  AAT Found bug with regards to GRIB1 polar stereographic.  Need tangent
          lat of 90 or -90, rather than 0 (which is mercator).
 5/5  AAT Fixed .dbf to handle the default missing value from GRIB1.  It now
          increases (or decreases) to fit the data being stored.
 5/5  AAT Got rid of .prj creation by the -Flt option, since ArcView
          doesn't need it, and it gets in the way of ArcExplorer using .shp
          files.
#
#----- Release: Version 1.1 05/02/2003 -----
#
 5/2  AAT Cleaned up makefile's some.
 5/1  AAT Started running tests and getting ready to test on other platforms
 4/30 AAT Added inventory capability to the grib1 code.
 4/29 AAT Cleaned up the grib1 code.
 4/29 AAT Finished off the "small" polgon addition.
 4/28 AAT Added the ability to save to "small" polygon shape file.
 4/10 - 4/25 [ :-)  ...Vacation...  :-) ]
 4/9  AAT Use meters instead of mm for Dx,Dy. (gds)
 4/9  AAT Continue parsing GRIB1 PDS section.
 4/9  AAT Renaming of Di,Dj -> Dx,Dy, along with other changes to sect3 (gds)
 4/8  AAT Started merging GRIB 1 code with GRIB 2 code
 4/2-3 AAT Continued GRIB 1.
 4/1  AAT Started adding GRIB 1 capability.
 3/31 AAT Fixed the warning generated by compiling using g++.
 3/31 AAT errno is not necessarily reset before calling code, so .shp write
          could have "failed" before it tried.  We now set it to 0 first.
          see http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2002-06/msg00044.html
 3/28 AAT Started in on updates to gis.tcl..
 3/27 AAT Continued work on message numbers... finished?? tcldegrib.c
          Need to work on .tcl side of it.
 3/26 AAT Started using 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 for message numbers where major number
          is which GRIB2 message, minor is which grid in that message.
 3/26 AAT Implemented multiple grids in same GRIB2 message for read option.
 3/26 AAT Got rid of #undef NEED_IWORK from degrib.c (an experiment with
          Fortran / C interfaces.
 3/25 AAT Implemented multiple grids in the same GRIB2 message during
          an inventory.
 3/25 AAT Converted "IsGRIB2" from Tcl to C.
 3/25 AAT During Inventory: If we detect at least 1 GRIB2 message, then
          allow trailing bytes.  This allows for GRIB2 messages which are
          padd'ed out to the 4 byte boundary, or use FORTRAN binary routines.
 3/25 AAT satellite data: can now inventory it.
 3/21 AAT Found trailing %s in calls to preErrSprintf... Causes memory fault.
 3/19 AAT Added reftime,mtimeList to ndfd.tcl check of the date on the data
          files, since they may be updated by other programs.
 3/19 AAT Continued to add support for satellite data.
 3/17 AAT Started to add support for GS4_SATELLITE (template 4.30)
#
#----- Release: Version 1.01 03/12/2003 -----
#
 2/26 AAT & Rici Yu : realized that imageGen.logPref needs lf instead of crlf.
 2/26 AAT Added "catch {}" around imageGen exec (ndfd.tcl:NDFD_GenImages)
          to avoid logPref errors.
 2/26 AAT At request of NWS Forecasters, replaced all instances of "Region"
          with "Sector".
 2/26 AAT Replaced B/W paper with Color ("newDB.pdf")
#
#----- Release: Version 1.0 02/21/2003 -----
#
 2/21 AAT Found error in myerror.c:AllocSprintf () (need to have 330 bytes for
          printing a double since the max double is +1.7E+308, and I need room
          for stuff after decimal place.  This affected the PoP12 test suite
          since it uses really old data that has really old threshold numbers.
 2/21 AAT Finished up meta print (version 1) for Weather.
 2/20 AAT Did some more work on Weather, and thought about NetCDF
 2/19 AAT Started work on Weather
 2/11 (Rici Yu) solution to win98 bug: have "w9xpopen.exe" in ./bin
 2/11 (Ana Canizares) Started distributing CONUS (Max / Min) Temperature fields
 2/10 AAT Discovered error with python and win98
 2/9-2/14 AAT AMS Conference...
#
#----- Release: Version 0.98 02/06/2003 -----
#
 2/6  AAT Changed interpretation of (scale factor / value) to be consistent
          with what the WMO experts suggested. (Affects meta data for PoP12)
 2/6  AAT Bug in location of the .flt files.  Need to shift by half a grid
          cell, due to the fact that ArcView appears to work with the center
          of the grid, as opposed what we had been computing which was the
          lower left corner.  If all is corect, putting the .shp file on top
          of the .flt file will result in the .shp file point being in the
          center of the .flt grids.
 2/5  AAT Renamed tcldegrib to tkdegrib (since it requires Tk...)
 2/5  AAT Added -reset option to reset the inventory in the Tcl interface.
          Used when we have downloaded a file, and want to make sure we get
          a new inventory.
 1/31 AAT Added -nMSB -nFlt -nShp -nMet to Tcl interface to be similar to
          degrib interface.
 1/31 AAT Enabled all Boolean operators through Tcl interface to have either
          1 or 2 args... If Tcl doesn't recognize following argument as a
          boolean it uses default value.  This affects -Flt -Shp -Met
          -Interp -revFlt -MSB
 1/31 AAT Added -I / -C / -V to Tcl interface to be similar to degrib interface
#
#----- Release: Version 0.93 01/29/2003 -----
#
 1/29 AAT Found out it was 202 not 208 to handle section 2 data, also
          increased the loop to 8 times through instead of 5 for extra safety.

 1/23 AAT Informed we will have weather grids shortly
 1/22 AAT Tracked down bug in degrib2.c::ReadSECT0()
 1/22 AAT Switched ../tclsrc to ./tclsrc in tclstart.c (so we have /bin/tclsrc)
 1/21 AAT Worked with Bill Cassanova Weather Channel to get it to work on Sun
 1/16 AAT Relabeled "sky" to "Sky"
 1/15 AAT Rename of /NDFD_grib2Decoder to /NDFD_GRIB2Decoder
          (now have 3 names: /degrib /NDFD_grib2Decoder /NDFD_GRIB2Decoder)
 1/15 AAT Continued with NDFD AMS CD,
          Found that lower/left lat/lon in midatlantic did not match the tile

          shape files...
12/31 AAT Added imbeded version info.
12/31 AAT Continued work on ParseGrid().
12/24 AAT Performance Boost ~.15 sec / message.
          metaparse.c ParseGrid() Made it assume scan 0100 (valid 99.9%)
          in fast loop, but still have slow loop for generic case.
12/24 AAT Added preErrSprintf() (CR1).
12/23 AAT Updated files based on second code Review.

12/16 AAT Updated files based on first code Review.
#
#----- Release: Version 0.9 12/12/2002 -----
#
12/12 AAT Found out that cygwin gcc uses -Wl,--stack,2000000.  The unpacker
          library needs at lease -Wl,--stack,3500000 (Don't need alternative
          method for unpksecdif)
12/11 AAT Note: a Cygwin compile with -mno-cygwin does not handle the -g2c
          FORTRAN library correctly.  Use mingw, or give out cygwin1.dll(940k)?
          (To not use mingw, remove mingw from path in .cshrc)
12/11 AAT Tested alternative method for unpksecdif.
12/11 AAT Printed out code for review 2.
12/10 AAT Still looking for better way to handle automatic array issue.
12/9  (AAT & Tim Kempisty & Ana Canizares & Tim Boyer & Marc Saccucci)
          Code Review (cstart.c, userparse.c, degrib2.c, inventory.c)
12/6  AAT Finished -P option (takes 2 min to run, need to improve)
12/4  AAT Found that I cast tcldegrib message num to (sChar) instead of (int)
12/4  AAT Found that if IWORK is an automatic array in unpksecdif.f, then
          it causes a sofware exception and crash on MS-Windows(cygwin + g77)
          compilation... Decided to allocate that in degrib2.c and pass it
          in to FORTRAN.  Other autotmaic arrays are considerably smaller.
          (Sample data was message 2 from kwbn_dt.161915_20021204160000.conus)
          This affects: UNPK_GRIB2.f, UNPK_SECT7.f, UNPK_CMPLX.f, UNPKSECDIF.f
12/2  AAT Started in on -P command.
12/2  AAT Added "-namePath [Path]" option to "tcldegrib" (since GUI does not
          use -nameStyle option yet, jury rigged a test)
11/27 AAT added "-namePath [Path]" to "degrib"
11/27 AAT added "-nameStyle 3" to "degrib" and "tcldegrib"
11/27 AAT Added "-msg all" to "degrib" and "tcldegrib"
11/26 AAT Completed -Unit option, should affect the following tests:
          maxT, minT, T, Td, Wnds, newmaxT
11/26 AAT Updated references to the web site from 140 site to
          www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/NDFD_grib2Decoder
11/25 AAT Switched to MOIST_TOT_SNOW in ElementName() (degrib2.c)
11/25 AAT Noticed enum error in meta.h (missing MOIST_CLOUDMIX_RATIO,
          MOIST_ICEMIX_RATIO, MOIST_RAINMIX_RATIO)
11/25 AAT Moved web site from 140 site to
          www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/NDFD_grib2Decoder
11/22 AAT Discovered fprintf (fp, msg); bug... If msg has a % in it (unit),
          then the unit does not get printed.  use (fp, "%s", msg);
          Affects "./test/testsky.sh" results.
11/21 AAT Finished printing out the Code Review material.
#
#----- Release: Version 0.85 11/20/2002 -----
#
11/20 AAT Finished testing it on PC/Linux/HP/AIX systems.
11/20 AAT Found that FindGRIBMsg needs offset = 0.
11/20 AAT Found memory problem when using UserFree() in cstart.c
11/19 AAT Doesn't complain about a length of 0, 21, 21+19 or 21+19+21+19 bytes

          "old" 11/15 GRIB2 data to test.
11/19 AAT Finished the commenting on the Tcl/Tk code.
11/18 AAT Finished the commenting on the C code.
11/15 AAT Figured out how to compile only a -mwindows (rather than a -mconsole)
          in Cygwin/Mingw
11/15 AAT Broke userparse.c out of cstart.c and tcldegrib.c and Re-worked
          tcldegrib.c
11/14 AAT Finished all the degrib.c commenting.
11/13 AAT Broke Inventory procedures out of degrib.c and into inventory.c
11/13 AAT Decided that .flt file should stay by default Big Endian, since
          other programs I have written assume Big Endian (and GRIB2 message
          itself is Big Endian).
11/8  (Albion D Taylor) Reports success with tcldegrib using new
          makefile.aix on his systems.
11/8  AAT Added option to create Little Endian .flt / .tlf files
          (for interface to NDFD GD .png creator).
11/8  AAT Added option to create .tlf files (for interface to NDFD GD .png
          creator) (changed the call to gribWriteFloat)
11/6  AAT Realized that I wasn't looking for GRIB "missing" values before
          doing computations for radius of earth, unit conversion etc.
          (could have had 4294967295 * 10 ** 255 or -2147483647 * 10 ** -127)
11/6  AAT Was using old definition of Scale Factor & Scale Value.
11/6  AAT Found that tcldegrib doesn't work yet on AIX.
11/6  AAT Created grib2unpacker makefile.linux, and makefile.win.  This
          replaces makefile.g77
#
#----- Release: Version 0.8 11/05/2002 -----
#
11/5  AAT diff -b does not work (the same way) on suitland AIX.
          "clean" the ./degrib/ans text files (to replace CR/LF with only LF)
11/5  AAT Ran into unsigned char / signed char problem on Suitland AIX system
          char usually is a signed char (on AIX char is a unsigned char)
          use: -qchars=signed (and use signed/unsigned more consistently in
          own code)
11/4  AAT Found that 5 decimals for lat/lon in .shp gives identical files
          on HP/Linux/PC.  6 decimals works for Linux/PC, 7 doesn't match.
          Using 5 decimals.
11/4  AAT Found that when writing the .dbf file in linux, it doesn't like
          'const' variables mixed in with the fwrite or fputc commands.
11/4  AAT Found and fixed bug in degrib: -C without a -I caused problems.
10/31 AAT Found that #defines in endian.h did not work properly on Linux.
          Needed to #undef BIG_ENDIAN before test.
10/31 AAT Found out that the HP is not creating correct size for .shp set.
          Cause: NFS mounted directory was timing out on the 20Meg write.
10/30 AAT implemented version.txt and history.txt
10/30 AAT Enabled -msg option, and -interp option.
10/28 AAT Created and tested basic command line options for 'degrib'
10/28 AAT Sent out Beta Release to a number of MDL people for them to check
          out the web site.
